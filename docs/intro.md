Once your new account is created, copy your API_KEY:

```

## Integrate with your Nextjs website

Install the web2to3 react package to integrate with your Nextjs website

```bash
npm install web2to3@web2to3 
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Web2To3 (i.e solana, solana-wallets).
