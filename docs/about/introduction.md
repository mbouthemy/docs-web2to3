# Introduction

We have started building Web2To3 during the two first Solana hackathons with the idea that play2earn games would be the next best thing
of the Web3. 

After successfully created a Chess2Earn game during the hackathon, we have decided to expand our smart contract and made it available to 
all the developers by developing an API which allows web developers to integrate with blockchains (Solana, Polygon...) even if they have little
experience in this field or in Rust.

## What is Web2To3?
Web2To3 is an API which you can use to transform any kind of game into a play2earn game.

At the moment, it only supports integration with Nextjs website, but we are planning to integrate it soon with mobiles applications
and Unity games, stay tuned!

## Thank you and stay in touch!
