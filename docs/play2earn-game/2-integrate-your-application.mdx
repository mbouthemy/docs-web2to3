# 2. Installing the package

Install the play2earn react package to integrate with your Nextjs website.

```bash
npm install play2earn 
```

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Web2To3 (i.e solana, solana-wallets).


Once it is installed, you need to add the following variable to your `.env` file:


```bash
BACKEND_ENDPOINT=https://web2to3.herokuapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_HOST=YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME
API_KEY=YOUR_API8KEY
```

Where YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name that you defined when adding the game in the website.

Then you can integrate the Play2Earn modal to your game, before the launching game screen.

```js
import { Play2EarnModal, finishGameAndGetMoneyWebThree } from "play2earn";
```

```js
<Play2EarnModal gameWebsiteHost={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_HOST} 
                gameID={gameID}
                playerUID={user?.uid} 
                handleGameStarting={() => handleGameStarting()}
                secondsBeforeCancellation={60} />
```

You also need to add the function which is triggers when the game is starting (i.e after the one/two players have bet in case of 
solo/multiplayer game).

```js
async function handleGameStarting() {
    console.log('Updating when the second player has accepted the bet.');
    // WRITE_YOUR_LOGIC_HERE...
}
```

Then, you need to add the function to end the game when one player has won.

```js
// Call this function when the game is finished with the winnerID
finishGameAndGetMoneyWebThree(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_HOST, gameID, winnerID, winnerID, false)
    .then(resultSignature => {
        console.log('The money has been transferred to your account, the signature is: ', resultSignature);
    });
}
```
