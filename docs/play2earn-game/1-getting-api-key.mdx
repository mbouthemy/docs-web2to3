# 1. Getting API Key

Get started by **creating a new account** to get your API key.

Go to  **[Web2To3/signup](https://www.web-2-to-3.com/signup)** and create a new account.

Once your new account is created, copy your API_KEY:

You can then create a new game and add the information required.
Even if you have not deployed your game to your domain, you can add a random one to test it locally.
