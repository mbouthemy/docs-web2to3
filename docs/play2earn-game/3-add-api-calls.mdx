# 3. Adding the API call

In order to secure your API call and make sure no one is triggering the call before the game ends,
there are two possibilities:

1. You can create your own backend and relay the calls to it, in particular when the game is finished.

2. You can use Nextjs to create your own backend and add the following files in the folder `pages/api/`.

For now, we strongly recommand you to use the second option as it is the easiest implementation

You can just copy and paste the following files [example API](https://github.com/mbouthemy/chess2earn-example/tree/master/src/pages/api)
in your Nextjs application.
